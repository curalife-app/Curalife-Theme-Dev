                            blood
                            sugar level. Thousands of CuraLin users take CuraLin alongside their prescribed drugs
                            and
                            treatments and no serious negative interactions have been recorded. Of course, please
                            consult with your doctor before starting on CuraLin, whether you’re on drugs or not.</p>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>CuraLife was founded by Ron when his father needed help with glucose support. None of the
                            products he tried and none of the lifestyle changes he made where helping. So Ron, flew
                            around the world looking for something that would help. Ron was introduced to a family
                            of
                            Ayurvedic doctors on an educational trip to India. They developed a glucose support
                            formula
                            together, and after years of research and testing, CuraLin was born. Today, CuraLin is
                            used
                            by over 100,000 customers around the world.</p>
