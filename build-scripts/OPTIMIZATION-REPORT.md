npm run dev

# Production builds
npm run build

# Performance analysis
npm run analyze

# Fallback if issues
npm run build:legacy
```

### **Configuration Customization**

Create `curalife.config.js` for custom settings:

```javascript
export default {
	ui: { theme: "cyberpunk" },
	performance: { workers: 4 },
	watch: { debounce: 200 }
};
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Verification Steps**

### **Performance Verification**

1. **Run build comparison:**

   ```bash
   # Time the old system
   time npm run build:legacy

   # Time the new system
   time npm run build
   ```

2. **Check memory usage:**

   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```

3. **Verify cache functionality:**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # First run
   npm run build  # Second run (should be much faster)
   ```

### **Stability Testing**

1. **Process cleanup test:**

   - Start build, interrupt with Ctrl+C
   - Verify no hanging processes

2. **Error recovery test:**

   - Introduce syntax error in source file
   - Verify graceful error handling

3. **Memory stress test:**
   - Run multiple builds concurrently
   - Monitor memory usage stability
