# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the Shopify theme's development workflow with optimized build processes and hot reloading capabilities. Specific areas include:

1. **Build Process Enhancement**: Implementing Vite for faster build times and modern JavaScript processing, replacing older webpack-based approaches.

2. **Development Workflow**: Creating a seamless development environment with file watching and auto-reloading for rapid iteration.

3. **Shopify Integration**: Establishing reliable connections between local development and Shopify's theme preview functionality.

4. **CSS Framework Implementation**: Leveraging Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across the theme.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks in the theme's rendering and loading processes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

- **Build Tool**: Using Vite over webpack for faster builds and better developer experience
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS chosen for rapid development and consistency
- **JavaScript Approach**: Using vanilla JS with modular organization instead of a framework
- **File Structure**: Implementing a clear separation between source and build directories
- **Deployment Process**: Using automatic builds with hot reloading during development

### Design Decisions

- **Mobile First**: Building with mobile-first approach for better responsive behavior
- **Component Library**: Creating a consistent set of UI components to be used across the site
- **Typography**: Implementing a clear typographic hierarchy for content readability
- **Color System**: Defining a flexible color system that maintains brand consistency
- **Animation Strategy**: Using subtle animations to enhance user experience without sacrificing performance

### Process Considerations

- **Version Control**: Maintaining clear branching strategy with feature branches
- **Testing Strategy**: Implementing cross-browser and device testing procedures
- **Shopify Limitations**: Working within Shopify's platform constraints while maximizing customization
- **Performance Budgets**: Setting clear performance targets for page load times
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring WCAG compliance throughout development

### Current Challenges

- Optimizing the hot reload process for maximum developer efficiency
- Balancing rich media content with performance requirements
- Ensuring consistent behavior across multiple Shopify environments
