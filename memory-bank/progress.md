- **Preview Mode**: Occasional disconnect between local changes and preview
- **Asset URLs**: Inconsistent handling of asset URLs in some contexts
- **Metafields**: Limited metafield support in some template areas
- **API Limitations**: Checkout customization limited by Shopify's constraints

### Browser Compatibility
