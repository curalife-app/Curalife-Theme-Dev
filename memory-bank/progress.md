## Current Status

### Development Phase

The project is currently in the **early development phase**, focusing on establishing the core development workflow and theme architecture. The primary emphasis has been on setting up an efficient development environment with Vite, file watching, and hot reloading capabilities.

### Latest Accomplishments

1. Migrated build system from webpack to Vite
2. Implemented custom file watching for Shopify theme development
3. Created hot reload functionality for rapid iteration
4. Set up Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
5. Established basic theme layout and structure
6. **Fixed quiz error handling** - Added proper error detection for workflow failures in both initial webhook response and polling logic, moved error check to be first priority

### Current Focus

The team is currently focused on:

1. Finalizing the development workflow
2. Completing the cart drawer functionality
3. Enhancing product page templates
4. Implementing responsive design for mobile devices
5. Setting up global components for reuse across the theme

### Timeline Status

- **Phase 1: Development Environment Setup** - 90% Complete
- **Phase 2: Core Theme Architecture** - 60% Complete
- **Phase 3: Key Page Templates** - 30% Complete
- **Phase 4: Enhanced Features** - 10% Complete
- **Phase 5: Testing and Optimization** - 5% Complete

## Known Issues

### Development Workflow

- **Hot Reload Timing**: Occasionally, the hot reload process has race conditions that require manual refresh
- **Cache Clearing**: Some file changes don't properly trigger cache invalidation
- **CSS Processing**: Tailwind processing can be slow on large changes
- **File Watching**: Some file types don't consistently trigger rebuild

### Theme Implementation

- **Mobile Navigation**: Current implementation needs usability improvements
- **Cart Drawer**: Animation performance issues on some mobile devices
- **Image Loading**: Occasional layout shift during image loading
- **Font Loading**: Flash of unstyled text on initial page load
- **Responsive Design**: Some breakpoint inconsistencies in the layout

### Shopify Integration

- **Theme Editor**: Some section settings don't update live in the editor
- **Preview Mode**: Occasional disconnect between local changes and preview
- **Asset URLs**: Inconsistent handling of asset URLs in some contexts
- **Metafields**: Limited metafield support in some template areas
- **API Limitations**: Checkout customization limited by Shopify's constraints
- ~~**Quiz Error Handling**: Workflow errors not properly detected during polling~~ ✅ **FIXED**

### Browser Compatibility

- **Safari**: Minor styling inconsistencies in Safari browsers
- **Legacy Browsers**: Graceful degradation needed for older browsers
- **iOS**: Touch event handling issues in some components
- **Android**: Performance optimization needed for lower-end devices

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix hot reload race conditions
2. Complete cart drawer implementation
3. Finalize product page template
4. Implement responsive navigation
5. Optimize asset loading

### Next Sprint Goals

1. Complete collection template with filtering
2. Implement search functionality
3. Enhance blog templates
4. Improve performance metrics
5. Add customer account features

## Known Issues

❗ **Cache Optimization**

- Current caching strategy may lead to occasional cache misses
- Cache keys could be optimized for better hit rates

❗ **Dashboard Speed**

- Dashboard can become slow to load with many historical data points
- Trend visualization performance can be improved

❗ **Error Handling**

- Some edge cases in test failures need better error messages
- Occasional false positives on slow network connections

## Technical Debt

🧰 **Script Organization**

- Shell scripts could be further modularized
- Some duplicate code exists between scripts
- Error handling can be standardized across scripts

🧰 **Dashboard Code**

- HTML generation uses string concatenation instead of templates
- CSS could be optimized and minimized
- JavaScript lacks proper error handling in some cases
