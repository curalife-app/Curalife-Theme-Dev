|How long does shipping take?:You will get a tracking number as soon as your order ships so that you can see exactly where your package is. Most orders in the continental USA arrive between 2-5 days after placing the order (depending on where in the US you live). Orders from the UK take an average of 7-8 days to arrive. Orders from Australia and the Asia Pacific Region can take a bit longer. Our official policy is that shipping can take 7-28 business days, but that’s just because of the uncertainty of shipping times these days. Your order will almost always arrive much faster than that, and your tracking number will always keep you up to date.
|Will I be able to track my order?:Yes! Every CuraLin order comes with a tracking number. You will be able to see where your package is any time you want – from the moment it ships, until the moment it reaches your home.
